    <string name="photo_res">A photoresistor is a light-sensitive resistor whose resistance decreases as light intensity increases.  Also known as an LDR, its a simple, inexpensive component used in light-sensing circuits. In the dark, its resistance is high, and in the light, its low, making it ideal for applications like automatic streetlights.</string>
    <string name="pir">A PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor is a motion detector that senses the infrared radiation (heat) emitted by objects.  Its called "passive" because it does not emit any energy itself. The sensor contains two slots, each with a pyroelectric material that generates a charge when exposed to infrared light. When a warm body, like a person or animal, moves into the sensor field of view, it first enters one slot and then the other, creating a differential change in the infrared reading. This change is what the sensor detects, triggering its output pin to go high. PIR sensors are widely used in security alarms and automatic lighting systems.</string>
    <string name="mq">he MQ-135 is a common gas sensor designed to detect a wide range of harmful gases in the air. Its highly sensitive to compounds like ammonia (NH3), sulfur (S), benzene (C6H6), carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke.  The sensor works by using a heated sensing element that changes resistance when it comes into contact with these gases. An Arduino can measure this resistance change using its analog input pin. The MQ-135 is widely used for air quality monitoring and environmental protection projects, allowing users to build alarms or alerts for detecting pollution and hazardous conditions.</string>
    <string name="soil">A soil moisture sensor is a simple and effective tool for measuring the amount of water in the soil.  It typically consists of two exposed probes that act as a variable resistor. When inserted into the soil, the electrical conductivity between the probes changes based on the soil moisture level. Dry soil has high resistance, while wet soil has low resistance, as water and dissolved ions make it more conductive. The sensor outputs an analog signal that can be read by a microcontroller like an Arduino. This makes it ideal for automated plant watering systems or monitoring the health of crops by providing real-time data on soil moisture content.</string>
    <string name="motor">A motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy to produce motion. It works on the principle of electromagnetism, using the force between a magnetic field and an electric current to make a shaft rotate. Motors come in various types, such as DC motors and stepper motors, each suited for different applications. DC motors provide continuous rotation, while stepper motors offer precise, incremental movements. They are fundamental components in countless devices, from fans and electric cars to robotics and remote-controlled toys.</string>
    <string name="buzz">A buzzer, or audio transducer, is a simple device that converts an electrical signal into sound.  It typically uses the piezoelectric effect, where a ceramic disc vibrates when an electric voltage is applied, creating an audible tone. When connected to a microcontroller like an Arduino, you can produce different pitches by varying the frequency of the signal. Buzzers are commonly used as **audible indicators**, for creating simple melodies, or as an alert system in alarms, timers, and other electronic projects. They provide a simple, effective way to add sound to your circuit.</string>
